            <!-- Question:1 -->
            <h3>Question:1 Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage.</h3>
            <p>
                >-- Local Storage: The Local Storage object stores the data with no expiration date. The data will not
                be
                deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year. <br> <br>

                >-- Session Storage: The session Storage object is equal to the localStorage object, except that it
                stores the data for only one session. The data is deleted when the user closes the specific browser tab.
            </p>

            <!-- Question:2  -->
            <h3>Question:2 Difference between Global scope and Block scope.</h3>
            <p>
                >-- Block scope: Block is the code found inside a set of curly braces {}. Inside those curly braces we
                typically write out the business logic for our functions, statements and so on. <br><br>
                >-- Global scope: In global scope, variables are declared outside of blocks or inside the block scope.
                These variables are called global variables. Because global variables are not bound inside a
                block, they can be accessed by any code in the program, including code in blocks.
            </p>

            <!-- Question:3  -->
            <h3>Question:3 How does Event loop work in java script?</h3>
            <p>
                >-- An event loop is a mechanism: That allows JavaScript to execute a
                callback function after a given event has occurred. Event loops are important because they allow
                JavaScript to handle events asynchronously. This means that JavaScript can continue to execute code
                while waiting for an event to occur. JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one
                operation can be executed at a time. However, JavaScript is able to simulate concurrent operations by
                using an event loop.

            <!-- Question:4  -->
            <h3>Question:4 Get the code undefined</h3>
            <p>
                >-- Code undefined: <br>
                1. Declared variable name but not define value. <br>
                2. Variable not initialized but accesse than result is undefined. <br>
                3. Console log function but function is no return. <br>
                4. Console log function but function peramiter not pass. <br>
                5. If return has nothing then return is undefined. <br>
                6. Property that doesn't exists on an object will give undefined.
                7. Accessing array elements outside of the index range. <br>
                8. Deleting an element inside an array. <br>
                9. Set a value directly to undefined.
